ActsAsDependentMapper
=====================

Has one class perform the database mapping for a child class.

Some objects naturally appear in the context of other objects.

Tracks on an album may be loaded or saved whenever the
underlying album is loaded or saved. If they aren't referenced
to by any other table in the database, you can simplify the mapping
procedure by having the album mapper perform the mapping for the
tracks as well - treating this mapping as a dependent mapping.

Example
=======

class UserArticle < ActiveRecord::Base
   acts_as_dependent_mapper :sequence => [:article, [:journal, [:publisher]]]
   # Your code goes here
   # ...
end
